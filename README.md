# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜Š

I'm Emil Ernerfeldt, and I like Rust!

I'm the creator of [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui), the friendly GUI library.

I am also the co-founder of [Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/), a company making visualization tooling for computer vision and robotics.

Follow me on twitter [@ernerfeldt](https://twitter.com/ernerfeldt) for news about egui and Rerun :)
